# Mental Wellness Coach AI Agent Platform 🧠💚

## Inspiration

Mental health support has become increasingly crucial in our fast-paced digital world, yet access to quality mental healthcare remains limited by cost, availability, and stigma. We were inspired by the growing mental health crisis, especially among young professionals and students who often lack immediate access to support when they need it most.

The idea sparked from recognizing that AI technology could democratize mental health support by providing 24/7 accessible, privacy-first emotional guidance. We envisioned a platform that could serve as a trusted digital companion - not to replace human therapists, but to provide immediate support, early intervention, and daily mental wellness maintenance.

What truly motivated us was the potential to combine cutting-edge AI technology with proven mental health practices, creating a solution that's both technologically advanced and therapeutically sound.
